[Kernel Distance Metric Learning using Pairwise Constraints for Person Re-Identification](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2870941)

k-KISSME contains the implementation of Kernel distance metric learning using pairwise constraints for person re-identification.
For any question, please contact [Bac Nguyen](mailto:Bac.NguyenCong@ugent.be).


### Prerequisites
This has been tested using MATLAB 2010A and later on Windows and Linux (Mac should be fine).

### Installation
Download the folder "CMML" into the directory of your choice. Then within MATLAB go to file >> Set path... and add the directory containing "k-KISSME" to the list (if it isn't already). That's it.

### Usage

Please run (inside the matlab console)
```matlab
demo  % demo of k-KISSME
```
